      <p>
        I have been leading/managing teams on and off for 7 years, while still being a
        hands on engineer (see <a href="/history">History</a> for more information).
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the engineering part of my job (and hope I never have to give it up completely),
        but I also take great satisfaction in building a great team and helping
        them to work effectively, both within the team and with the wider business.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about Agile principles but believe that the team should
        decide how they actually function internally.
        E.g. selecting Kanban or Scrum should be up to the individual team.
      </p>

      <p>In a nutshell:</p>
      <blockquote>
        I want to be in a position to help a great team build the best platform
        that the consumer actually needs.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        How does that translate into a job title?
        As with all things in tech: naming things is hard.
        As such, the sorts of job titles I'm looking at are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team Lead</li>
        <li>Technical Lead</li>
        <li>Engineering Lead</li>
        <li>Software Manager</li>
        <li>Technical Director</li>
        <li>Senior Engineer</li>
        <li><strike>VP of Ninja Rockstart Hero Unicorning</strike> (no one needs this)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ... but realistically the title doesn't really matter.
        It's the people that matter and will shape everything else.
        No matter how successful a company is, if they don't actively
        foster a collaborative and respectful culture at every level of the
        organisation, then it's not for me.
        (Needless to say, there are certain 'ride sharing' companies I won't be
        calling.)

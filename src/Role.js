    <h1>Role</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In a nutshell:</p>
      <blockquote>
        I want to be in a position to help a great team write the best platform
        that the consumer actually needs.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        How does that translate into a job title?
        As with all things in tech: naming things is hard.
        As such, the sorts of job titles I'm looking at are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team Lead</li>
        <li>Technical Lead</li>
        <li>Engineering Lead</li>
        <li>Software Manager</li>
        <li>Technical Director</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ... but realistically the title doesn't really matter.
        It's the people that matter and will shape everything else.
        No matter how successful a company is, if they can't be said to
        foster a collaborative and respectful culture at every level of the
        organisation, then it's not for me.
        (Needless to say, there are certain 'ride sharing' companies I won't be
        calling up about a position.)
      </p>
    </div>
  </role>
)

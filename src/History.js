    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      In 2006 I graduated from the University of Sussex with a degree in Psychology BSc. (no, I don't have a CS degree).
      During university a fascination with computing, and specifically web development, grew into a real passion.
      Since getting my first job in software in 2006 I have worked in engineering ever since.

    <p>
      From 2011 until March 2017 I worked at <a href="https://www.ensighten.com/" target="_blank">Ensighten</a> in
      various roles from Senior Engineer to Technical Director.
      During my time at Ensighten I was lucky enough to be able to build a great team and work under some great managers.
      The team and I built very high-performance marketing/advertising/analytics SaaS platforms and accompanying front-ends.

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      In 2006 I graduated from the University of Sussex with a degree in Psychology BSc. (no, I don't have a CS degree).
      During university a fascination with computing, and specifically web development, grew into a real passion.
      Since getting my first job in software in 2006 I have worked in engineering ever since.
    </p>
    <p className="quietly">For the next 5 years I worked at a couple of marketing agencies
      on lead generation platforms
      (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/edr-agency" target="_blank">EDR</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Digital_Media" target="_blank">TMN Group</a>) and
      at <a href="https://www.premierit.com/" target="_blank">Premier IT</a> on
      a bespoke CMS platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently (2011 through 2017) I worked
      at <a href="https://www.ensighten.com/" target="_blank">Ensighten</a>.
      I started as a Senior Engineer and finished as a Technical Director.
      During my time at Ensighten I was lucky enough to be able to build a great team and work under some excellent managers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things, my team and I were responsible for building:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_management_system" target="_blank">Tag Management</a> platform.</li>
      <li>A high-performance <a href="https://www.ensighten.com/products/pulse/" target="_blank">data-collection/analytics platform</a>.</li>
      <li>An Attribution system (which interestingly <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-attribution-search-marketers-need-know-275751" target="_blank">google have recently launched</a>).</li>
    </ul>
